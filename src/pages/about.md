I was born and raised in Rome, and eventually made my way to the US. I'm currently a VP at 645 Ventures, where I invest in infrastructure software, security, and dev tools, as well as leading our engineering team. In my spare time, I play basketball, soccer, and Hearthstone along with some FPS games, but I'm starting to lose my touch!Â 

I also run a newsletter focused called [The Engineering Value Chain Revolution](http://engineeringvaluechain.substack.com), which focuses on developer tooling and software architectures.
