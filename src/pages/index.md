      I'm currently a VP at 645 Ventures, where I invest in infrastructure
      software, security, and dev tools, as well as leading our engineering
      team. I previously worked at a few different startups, founded my own,
      played competitive Halo and Call of Duty, was involved in the Pro
      Evolution Soccer modding scene, and a lot more stuff. Always happy to chat
      with folks with similar interests! You can find me at afanelli \[at]
      645ventures.com, or @FanaHOVA on Twitter.
